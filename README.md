  TOM DANIELS - ALT CONTROLLER GAME PROPOSAL
  
  
  For my alt controller assessment I plan to develop a wave defence game where the player controls a tank which must defend an objective from waves of enemy forces. Aside from the core mechanics of the game it's important to note the added element of an alternative controller and its effect on gameplay. The player controls their vehicle using a bespoke, alternative controller. Using two wheels, they may incrementally control the slew and elevation of their turret. Having to manage these separately shall make target acquisition tactile but difficult. Movement also utilizes the controller with two levers controlling the forward movement of the left and right tank tracks. 

	Aside from these points the format of gameplay is fairly simple, with the challenge and depth mostly stemming from the operation of the tank. Within the game there are enemy tanks, the player’s tank, a staging area for the spawning of enemies and a HQ zone which belongs to the player.

The player starts the game within their HQ, a zone which they must defend. They can move freely around the level. At game start enemies begin to spawn at the staging area, these are enemy tanks which move along a guided path to the enemy HQ. The enemies spawn in waves, their amount and delay are variable to difficulty. During movement they will attempt to fire at the player if they see them with limited accuracy.

The player has limited health points which are deducted when struck by enemy fire. The HQ also has health points which are lost when an enemy enters the HQ zone. If either of these health points reach zero the player has lost. To win the player must eliminate all waves of enemy tanks. This describes the only gamemode in the game, Defence. Before starting a game the player may choose from one of four difficulties, these affect the number of enemies in each wave, the rate at which waves arrive and finally the move speed of the enemies. 

Besides managing the health of their tank and HQ the player must also collect ammunition from around the map, starting with a small amount which they expend each time their fire. This will force the player to navigate the map.

The movement of the player's tank is difficult to manage, when combined with the tasks of managing ammunition and defending their base it shall produce a challenging experience. Two large wheels control the movement of the turret, one will raise/lower the barrel of the tank. The other will rotate the turret when turned. Two levers control movement, when the left is in full forward the tank shall rotate left. The same applies for the right lever which will turn the tank right. When both are in the forward position the tank moves straight forward. 

Visually the game is 3D with minimalistic graphics for a clean look. The player’s tank is controlled from a 3rd person view point which is held behind the tank. There will be a control that will allow the player to switch to a gunview camera which is from the perspective of the barrel of the tank. 

Aside from these points of gameplay the application shall have a main menu for managing the selection of difficulty and starting a game as well as the option to quit. There will also be a pause menu available to the player during gameplay.
